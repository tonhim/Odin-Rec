     <h3>
         Ingredients: (makes 5 rolls)
     </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>5 sheets of seaweed paper, roasted slightly</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>½ pound beef skirt steak</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>5 strips of yellow pickled radish</li>
        <li>8  to 10 ounces spinach</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon brown (or white) sugar</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2½ tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Steps:
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place a sheet of seaweed wrap on a bamboo mat with the shiny side down. Evenly spread about ¾ cup of cooked rice over top of it, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on one side of the seaweed wrap</li>
        <li>Place beef, carrot, yellow pickled radish strip, a few egg strips, and spinach in the center of the rice.</li>

        <li>Use both hands to roll the mat (along with gim and rice) over the fillings, so one edge of the rice and gim reaches the opposite edge. This centers the fillings in the roll, so they’ll be nicely in the middle when you slice it.</li>
        <li>Grab the mat with both hands and and press it tightly as you continue rolling the gimbap. Push out the mat as you roll, so it doesn’t get wrapped in the gimbap</li>

        <li>Repeat 4 more times with the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Put some toasted sesame oil on the finshed rolls and sprinkle some sesame seeds over top. Cut each roll into ¼ inch bite size pieces with a sharp knife, occasionally wiping it with a wet paper towel or cloth to clean the starch off and to ease cutting.</li>
